![Header Photo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21289530/131878497-7faee41a-c398-41de-9450-d74dd8f5ba22.png)


Our goal is to initiate a Decentralised Global Directory of DLT / Blockchain Educational Opportunities, that engages a Community to build and maintain it, and to develop a Tool Kit that supports this collaboration.

We want to identify and contact potential allies to link our inner Hyperledger Universe with the rest of the world. We need scouts to explore, register and map the outer territories beyond our community.

We accomplish this by creating a Global Directory of all the educational/learning opportunities in the DLT/Blockchain field. We have hosted this information on a website at https://global-directory-for-dlt.vercel.app/ and this repo holds the code for the website.

## Tech Stack 
We are using:
- __Neo4j__ for hosting the knowledge database.
- __NextJS__ for the jamstack.
- __Mongodb__ for User authentication and authorization.

## Contribution Guidelines. 
Before anything, I'm glad to have your interest, I'd really like your support and help.
I'd suggest please look into the issues, and the project section of this repository.
Apart from the development, I'm also looking for enthusiastic learners willing to curate resources for the knowledge Graph.
I'm in the process of creating a document explaining how to do that.

## Development
First, clone the repository by 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amitchaudhari9121/global-directory-for-dlt
```
Install the dependencies by navigating into the folder and running
```bash 
npm i
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with your browser to see the result.
Note:- The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
